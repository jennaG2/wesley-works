               <p>A graduate of <placeName type="education">Clare College, Cambridge</placeName>,
                  Dodd first sought a literary career. When it became clear he could not support
                  himself solely in this way, he was ordained in <date when="1752-01-01"
                  >1752</date>. He became a popular preacher in <placeName>London</placeName>,
                  especially from the pulpit of <placeName>Magdalen House</placeName>, and in <date
                     when="1763-01-01">1763</date>
                  was appointed chaplain to the king. He received his <seg ana="degree">DD</seg> in
                  1766. He was known as the &apos;macaroni parson&apos; because of his worldly style
                  of living, became deeply involved in debt, was arrested for forging a bond, was
                  convicted and sentenced to death. The execution was carried out on <date
                     when="1777-06-27">June 27, 1777</date>. He attacked JW&apos;s Arminian views in
                  the <hi rend="italic">Christian Magazine</hi> (<date when="1760-01-01"
                     >1760</date>–<date when="1767-01-01">67</date>), drawing JW&apos;s defense. At Dodd&apos;s
                  request, JW visited him in prison prior to his execution. See <hi rend="italic">Alumni
