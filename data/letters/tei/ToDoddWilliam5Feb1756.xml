            the info about the transcription. So I would simply move all the rest of the text in

                which I return to you my sincere thanks. Your frank and open manner of writing is
                far from needing any apology, and I hope I will never occasion your receiving such
                treatment from me as I did from Mr. <persName>[William] Law</persName> , who, after
                some very keen expressions in answer to the second private letter I sent him,
                plainly told me he desired to ‘hear no more on that head’ <note place="foot" n="3">

                    sir, be at peace with me.' See 25:543–46, 548–50 in this edn. </note> . I do
                desire to hear, and am very willing to consider, whatever you have to advance on the
                head of 'Christian
                perfection'.<!--"Christian Perfection" refers to both a document and a concept, and we will
                    link to the document internally when it's coded, but it's also a concept, oft-repeated. We
                should code it as theme now, with this as the value of the attribute: <seg
                ana="ChristianPerfection">  While we normally use camel case, Christian is a proper
                noun, so we'll go ahead and use uppercase for both words.-->

            <!--So, some notes, not about anything that's incorrect, but about what we'll be doing
                soon. We need to start creating unique identifies (idno elements) for specific

                    edn.). </note> You easily observe, I therein build on no authority, ancient or
                modern, but the Scripture. If this supports any doctrine, it will stand; if not, the
                sooner it falls the better. Neither the doctrine in question, nor any other, is
                anything to me, unless it be the doctrine of Christ and his
                apostles<!--I think we
                    should create a thematic tag for apostles, with the value simply being the same:
                apostles.-->.
                If, therefore, you will please to point out to me any passages in that sermon which
                are either contrary to Scripture, or not supported by it, and to show that they are
                not, I shall be full as willing to oppose as ever I was to defend them. I search for
                truth<!--Same for truth, which is a huge concept.-->: plain, Bible truth, without
                any regard to the praise or dispraise of men. </p>
            <closer> If you will assist me in this search, more especially by showing me where I
                have mistaken my way, it will be gratefully acknowledged by, rev. sir, <lb/>
