         <head>To <persName>the Printer of the Leedes
               Intelligencer</persName><note place="foot" n="1">The <hi rend="italic">Leedes
                  Intelligencer</hi> printed in its <date when="1758-08-29">Aug. 29, 1758</date>
               issue a letter (included in the online &apos;in-letters&apos; file), falsely
               purporting to be by <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>,
               addressing criticisms of <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />his</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Address to the Clergy</hi>. Now printing <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s disavowal, the editor
               added the following comment: &apos;We think ourselves obliged to declare that the <hi
                  rend="italic">Expostulatory Letter</hi> was not printed, as Mr. <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName> imagines, at Leedes. Mr.
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName> best knows the
               motives that have induced <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />him</persName> to publish a number of volumes, and if <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> candidly judges of others by
                     <persName>h<ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>imself</persName>,
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> may possibly have
               abundance of reason to be convinced, even without reading a page of it, that the <hi
                  rend="italic">Expostulatory Letter</hi> was merely a device to get a little money.
               Whether the author of that letter be a follower of Mr. <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName> or not, he may, for ought
               that appears in the letter, be as sincerely desirous of promoting the interest of
               true religion as Mr. <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName>
               himself. There are some doubts proposed which it seems no way unbecoming [for] the
               younger disciples, at least, of Mr. <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />Wesley</persName> to entertain. And if <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> would fairly remove those doubts,
               this would tend, one would presume, more to their satisfaction and be more suitable
               to the character <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> assumes
               than to treat the performance with contempt. The like treatment (in the least degree)
               of any thing that <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> has
               published, <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>his</persName> followers
               have been taught to call not answering but railing. And if they can be satisfied with
               the like practice in <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>him</persName>
               which they so warmly condemn in others, this proves nothing but Mr. <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName>&apos;s great ability to
               impose upon the understanding of <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />his</persName> admirers. &apos;The letter signed <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>J. W</persName>. printed in our paper of the
                  <date when="1758-08-29">29th of August</date> we really believed to be Mr.
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName>&apos;s own
               writing. And since <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> does
               not plainly deny it to be <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />his</persName>, it may, at least till <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> think proper to explain
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>himself</persName> further, be
               looked upon as a necessary paternal admonition to some of <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>his</persName> over-zealous disciples, though
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>he</persName> may not be
               unwilling to have the world amused by Mr. [<persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers0923.xml"/>John] Hampson</persName>&apos;s daring
               disavowal of that <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> letter. However this be, if Mr.
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName> thinks it
               expedient to clear the point with more precision, we shall readily give what he shall
               send for that purpose a place in our paper.&apos;</note></head>

            <salute>Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I was a little surprised at one of your papers which was sent me lately, wherein was
            inserted a letter supposed to be wrote by me and containing a kind of answer to an <hi
               rend="italic">Expostulatory Letter</hi> printed (as I imagine) at Leedes some time
               since.<note place="foot" n="2">[<persName>Richard Fawcett</persName>], <hi
                  rend="italic">An Expostulatory Letter to the Rev. Mr. <persName><ptr
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName>, occasioned by his
                  &apos;Address to the Clergy&apos;</hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>:
                  <persName>J. Wilkie</persName>, <date when="1757">1757</date>). A note to this
               letter says that <persName>Griffith Wright</persName>, the printer of the <hi
                  rend="italic">Leedes Intelligencer</hi>, also sells this <hi rend="italic"
                  >Expostulatory Letter</hi>.</note> I was not likely to answer that harmless thing,
            for in truth I never read a page of itâ€”being convinced by reading a few lines that it
            was merely a device to get a little money. Nevertheless, if the author will subscribe
            his real name, perhaps some farther notice may be taken of him, by, sir,</p>
