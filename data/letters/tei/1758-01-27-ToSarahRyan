         <p>Last Friday,<note place="foot" n="2">I.e., <date when="1758-01-20">Jan.
               20</date>.</note> after many severe words, my <persName><ptr

                     ><persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> discreetly omits
               the identification of his wife, <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Mary
                  Wesley</persName>, in this published version.</note> left me, vowing
                  <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>she</persName> would see me no
            more. As I had wrote to you the same morning, I began to reason with myself till I
            almost doubted whether I had done well in writing or whether I ought to write to you at
            all. After prayer that doubt was taken away, yet I was almost sorry that I had written
            that morning. In the evening, while I was preaching at the chapel, <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>she</persName> came into the chamber where I had
            left my clothes, searched my pockets, and found the letter there which I had finished
            but had not sealed. While <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>she</persName>
            read it, God broke <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>her</persName> heart,
            and I afterwards found <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>her</persName> in
            such a temper as I have not seen <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"
               />her</persName> in for several years. <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"
               />She</persName> has continued in the same ever since. So I think God has given a
            sufficient answer with regard to our writing to each other.</p>
         <p>I still feel some fear concerning you. How have you found yourself since we parted? Have
            you suffered no loss by anything? Has nothing damped the vigour of your spirit? Is
            honour a blessing, and dishonour too? The frowns and smiles of men? Are you one and the
            same in ease or pain, always attentive to the voice of God? What kind of humility do you
            feel? What have you to humble you, if you have no sin?<note place="foot" n="4">Once
               again <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> probes

               committing sin in the specific sense of &apos;a voluntary transgression of a known

            employ it all, not only well, but as well as it is possible? What time have you for
            reading? I want you to live like an angel here below, or rather like the Son of God.
