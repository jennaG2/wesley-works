         <p>In my late letter to your lordship I used no ceremony: I suppose it was not expected
            from one who was so deeply injured. And I trust I used no rudeness; if I did, I am ready
            to ask your lordship&apos;s pardon.</p>
         <p>That letter &apos;related to a matter of fact published on your lordship&apos;s
            authority, which I endeavoured to falsify&apos;, and your lordship now again endeavours
            to support.<note place="foot"><bibl><hi rend="italic">The Bishop of Exeter&apos;s

         <p>The facts alleged are: First, That I told <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName> at
               <placeName>Mitchell</placeName>, &apos;You are in hell; you are damned already&apos;;
            Secondly, That I asked her to &apos;live upon free cost&apos;; Thirdly, That she
            determined to admit no more Methodists into her house.</p>
         <p>At first I thought so silly and improbable a story neither deserved nor required a
            confutation; but when my friends thought otherwise I called on <persName>Mrs.
               Morgan</persName>, who denied she ever said any such thing. I wrote down her words,
            part of which I transcribed in my letter to your lordship, as follows:</p>
         <p>On <date when="1750-08-25">Saturday, August 25, 1750</date>, <persName>Mr.
               Trembath</persName> of <placeName>St. Gennys</placeName>, <persName>Mr.
               Haime</persName> of <placeName>Shaftesbury</placeName>, and I, called at
               <persName>Mr. Morgan</persName>&apos;s at <placeName>Mitchell</placeName>. The
            servant telling me her master was not at home, I desired to speak with her mistress, the
            &apos;honest, sensible woman&apos;. I immediately asked, &apos;Did I ever tell you or
            your husband that you would be damned if you took any <seg ana="money">money</seg> of
            me?&apos; (So the story ran in the first part of the Comparison it has now undergone a
            very considerable alteration.) &apos;Or did you or he ever affirm&apos; (another
            circumstance <note place="foot">i.e. Wesley&apos;s statement that she denied making die
               charge that he &apos;attempted to debauch a maid&apos;.</note> related at
               <placeName>Truro</placeName>) &apos;that I was rude with your maid?&apos; She replied
            vehemently, &apos;Sir, I never said you was, or that you said any such thing. And I
            don&apos;t suppose my husband did. But we have been belied as well as our
            neighbours.&apos; She added, &apos;When the bishop came down last, he sent us word he
            would dine at our house; but he did not, being invited to a neighbouring
            gentleman&apos;s. He sent for me thither, and said, &quot;Good woman, do you know these
            people that go up and down? Do you know <persName>Mr. Wesley</persName>? Did not he tell
            you, you would be damned if you took any <seg ana="money">money</seg> of him? And did
            not he offer rudeness to your maid?&quot; I told him, &quot;No, my lord; he never said
            any such thing to me, nor to my husband that I know of. He never offered any rudeness to
            any maid of mine. I never saw, or knew any harm by him. But a man told me once (who, I
            was told, was a Methodist Preacher) that I should be damned, if I did not know my sins
            were forgiven.&quot;<note place="foot">Wesley, <hi rend="italic"><bibl>Second Letter to
                     the Author of The Enthusiasm of the Methodists and Papists
               Compared</bibl></hi>, § 3, reprinted in <hi rend="italic"><bibl>The Bishop of
                     Exeter&apos;s Answer</bibl></hi>, pp. 5-7.</note></p>
         <p>Your lordship replies, &apos;I neither sent word that I would dine at their house, nor
            did I send for <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName>.…Every word that passed between us was
            at her own house at <placeName>Mitchell</placeName>.&apos;<note place="foot"><hi
                  rend="italic"><bibl>[The Bishop of Exeter&apos;s Answer]</bibl></hi>, p. 7.</note>
            I believe it; and consequently, that the want of exactness in this point rests on
               <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName>, not on your lordship.</p>
         <p>Your lordship adds, &apos;The following attestations will sufficiently clear me from any
            imputation, or even suspicion, of having published a falsehood.&apos; I apprehend
            otherwise. To waive what is past, if the facts now published by your lordship, or any
            part of them, be not true, then certainly your lordship will lie under more than a
            &apos;suspicion of having published a falsehood&apos;.</p>
         <p>The attestations your lordship produces are: First, those of your lordship&apos;s
               chancellor<note place="foot"><persName>Revd. John Fursman</persName>, Chancellor of
               Exeter Cathedral.</note> and archdeacon<note place="foot"><persName>Revd. William
                  Hole</persName>, Archdeacon of <placeName>Barnstaple</placeName>.</note>:
            Secondly, those of <persName>Mr. Bennet</persName>.<note place="foot"><persName>Revd.
                  Thomas Bennet</persName>, Vicar of <placeName>St Enoder</placeName>, who served
               the village of <placeName>Mitchell</placeName>.</note></p>
         <p>The former attest that in <date when="1748-06-01">June</date> or <date when="1748-07-01"
               >July, 1748</date>, <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName> did say those things to your
               lordship.<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"><bibl>[The Bishop of Exeter&apos;s
                     Answer]</bibl></hi>, pp. 8-10.</note> I believe she did, and therefore acquit
            your lordship of being the inventor of those falsehoods.</p>
         <p><persName>Mr. Bennet</persName> avers that in <date>January last</date><!--Need to
            verify year.-->
            <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName> repeated to him what she had before said to your
               lordship.<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"><bibl>[The Bishop of Exeter&apos;s
                     Answer]</bibl></hi>, pp. 11-12.</note> Probably she might; having said those
            things once, I do not wonder if she said them again.</p>
         <p>Nevertheless, before <persName>Mr. Trembath</persName> and <persName>Mr.
               Haime</persName> she denied every word of it.</p>
         <p>To get over this difficulty, your lordship publishes a second letter from <persName>Mr.
               Bennet</persName>, wherein he says: &apos;On <date when="1750-03-04">March 4th
               last</date><!--Not 100% sure this is the right year; need to verify.-->
            <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName> said, &quot;I was told by my servant that I was wanted
            above stairs; where, when I came, the chamber door being open, I found them
               (<persName>Mr. Wesley</persName> and others) round the table on their
            knees.&quot;&apos; He adds, &apos;That <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName> owned one
            circumstance in it was true; but as to the other parts of <persName>Mr.
               Wesley</persName>&apos;s letter to the bishop, she declares &apos;tis all
            false.&apos;</p>
         <p>I believe <persName>Mrs. Morgan</persName> did say this to <persName>Mr.
               Bennet</persName>, and that therefore neither is he <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Rev21:27">&apos;the maker of a lie&apos;</term>
            </index>. But he is the relater of a whole train of falsehoods, and those told merely
            for telling sake. I was never yet in any chamber at <persName>Mrs.
            Morgan</persName>&apos;s. I was never <hi rend="italic">above stairs</hi> there in my
            life. On <date when="1750-08-25">August 25, 1750</date>,<note/> was <hi rend="italic"
               >below stairs</hi> all the time I was in the house. When <persName>Mrs.
               Morgan</persName> came in I was <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> in the large parlour;
            nor did any of us <hi rend="italic">kneel</hi> while we were under the roof. This both
               <date>Mr. Trembath</date> and <date>Mr. Haime</date> can attest upon oath, whatsoever
            may declare to the contrary.</p>
         <p>But she declared farther (so <persName>Mr. Bennet</persName> writes), &apos;That
               <persName>Mr. John Wesley</persName> some time ago said to a maid of hers such things
            as were not fit to be spoken...<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"><bibl>[The Bishop of
                     Exeter&apos; Answer]</bibl></hi>, p. 11.</note> And <persName>Mr.
               Morgan</persName> declared that he &apos;did or said such indecent things to the
            above-named maid&apos; (the same fact, I presume, only a little embellished) &apos;in
            his chamber, in the night, that she immediately ran downstairs, and protested she would
            not go near him or any of the Methodists more&apos;.<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"
                     ><bibl>[The Bishop of Exeter&apos;s Answer]</bibl></hi>, p. 12.</note></p>
         <p>To save trouble to your lordship as well as to myself I will put this cause upon a very
            short issue. If your lordship will only prove that ever I lay one night in <persName>Mr.
               Morgan</persName>&apos;s house; nay, that ever I was in the town of
               <placeName>Mitchell</placeName> after sunset, I will confess the whole charge.</p>
         <p>What your lordship mentions &apos;by the way&apos; I will now consider: &apos;Some of
            your western correspondents imposed upon the <hi rend="italic">leaders of
               Methodisnty</hi> by transmitting to <placeName>London</placeName> a notoriously false
            account of my Charge to the clergy....Afterwards the Methodists confessed themselves to
            have been deceived; yet some time after the Methodists at <placeName>Cork</placeName> in
               <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, your own brother at the head of them, reprinted the
            same lying pamphlet, as my performance.&apos;<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"
                     ><bibl>[The Bishop of Exeter&apos;s Answer]</bibl></hi>, pp. 4-5.</note></p>
         <p>My lord, I know not who are your lordship&apos;s Irish correspondents; but here are
            almost as many mistakes as lines. For, (1). They were none of my correspondents who sent
            that account to <placeName>London</placeName>; (2). It was sent not to the &apos;leaders
            of Methodism&apos;, but to one who was no Methodist at all; (3). That it was a false
            account, I do not know. But your lordship may easily put it out of dispute. And many
            have wondered that your lordship did not do so long ago, by printing the Charge in
            question; (4). I did never confess it was a &apos;false account&apos;, nor any person by
            my consent, or with my knowledge; (5). That account was never reprinted at
               <placeName>Cork</placeName> at all; (6). When it was reprinted at
               <placeName>Dublin</placeName> your lordship had not disowned it; (7). My brother was
            not in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> when it was done; nor did either he or I know of it
            till long after.</p>
         <p>Therefore, when my brother was asked how he could reprint such an account after your
            lordship had publicly disowned it I do not at all wonder that &apos;he did not offer a
            single word in answer&apos;.<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"><bibl>[The Bishop of
                     Exeter&apos;s Answer]</bibl></hi>, p. 5.</note></p>
         <p>Whether this, as well as my former letter, be &apos;mere rant and
               declamation&apos;,<note place="foot"><hi rend="italic"><bibl>[The Bishop of
                     Exeter&apos;s Answer]</bibl></hi>, p. 15.</note> or plain and sober reason, I
            must refer to the world and your lordship&apos;s own conscience.</p>
